Security Audit using a Controls and Compliance Checklist

The Check list is used to conduct a security audit on a fictional company provided by coursera and google. I used the check list to validate current assets and controls
against current standards. I validated physical, technichal, and Administrative controls. Since the fictional company also accepted payments online validating that PCI DSS was being 
being followed is a must as well.
